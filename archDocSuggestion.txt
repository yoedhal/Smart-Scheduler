gemini suggestions:

1. Frontend Layer
Objective: The user interface where users view schedules, manage their "Fairness Score," and initiate meeting requests.

Component 1: Browser Application (SPA)

Technology: React (built with Vite), FullCalendar library for schedule visualization, and Axios for API requests.

Role: Renders a responsive user interface, manages local state, and presents data to the client.

Component 2: Hosting & Distribution (CDN)

Technology: Amazon S3 (Static Website Hosting) + Amazon CloudFront (CDN).

Role: S3 acts as the storage bucket for the static HTML/JS files. CloudFront distributes these files globally to ensure low latency and manages SSL/HTTPS security certificates.


2. Security & Entry Layer
Objective: Verifying user identity and managing secure access to external calendars (Google/Outlook).

Component 3: Identity Provider

Technology: Amazon Cognito.

Role:

Manages User Sign-up and Sign-in.

Critical: Securely encrypts and stores OAuth Tokens (Access/Refresh tokens) for Google and Outlook, allowing the backend to act on the user's behalf.

Component 4: API Gateway

Technology: Amazon API Gateway (REST API).

Role: The single entry point for the Frontend. It receives HTTP requests, validates the authentication token with Cognito, and routes valid requests to the backend logic.


3. Business Logic & Orchestration Layer
Objective: The system's "Brain." This layer executes the Fairness Algorithm and Dynamic Optimization.

Component 5: Workflow Orchestrator

Technology: AWS Step Functions.

Role: Manages the State Machine. Instead of a single monolithic function, it orchestrates the workflow logic: "Fetch Data -> Calculate Score -> If Score is low, Trigger Optimization -> Finalize."

Component 6: Compute Units (Microservices)

Technology: AWS Lambda (Python 3.9+).

Key Functions:

FetchCalendars: Connects to Google/Outlook APIs to retrieve events.

FairnessAlgo: Calculates the weighted "Fairness Score" for every available slot based on user history.

ReshuffleEngine: (Triggered only when necessary) Identifies low-priority meetings and moves them to resolve deadlocks.

BookingAgent: Finalizes the event creation in external calendars and updates the database.


4. Data Persistence Layer
Objective: Storing long-term data (User profiles, "Suffering" history, Meeting logs).

Component 7: NoSQL Database

Technology: Amazon DynamoDB.

Table A - UsersTable: Stores user profiles, preferences (e.g., "Morning Person"), and the current cumulative FairnessScore.

Table B - MeetingsTable: Logs metadata for meetings created by the system (used for auditing and future score calculations).

5. External Integrations
Google Calendar API / Microsoft Graph API: The external sources from which schedule data is pulled and where actual meetings are booked.

6. Infrastructure & DevOps
Component 8: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Technology: AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model).

Role: A template.yaml file defining the entire architecture as code. This allows for single-command deployment (sam deploy) and ensures environment consistency, preventing manual configuration errors.
